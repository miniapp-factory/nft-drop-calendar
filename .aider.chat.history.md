The files that will need to be edited or added to implement the requested changes are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
